<strong>Access Tahoe</strong> Provides affordable accessible transportation and lodging for people with disabilities from the San Francisco Bay and Sacramento Areas to North Lake Tahoe.  
We are excited to start offering some of our services for the 2014-2015 ski season.   The ski bus will be up and running but we will not be offering lodging until a future date.
